                <p>is everything that is around us. It can be living (biotic) or non-living (abiotic) things. It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces. Living things live in their environment. They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment. In the environment there are different interactions between animals, plants, soil, water, and other living and non-living things. Since everything is part of the environment of something else, the word environment is used to talk about many things. People in different fields of knowledge use the word environment differently. Electromagnetic environment is radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation and magnetic fields. The environment of galaxy refers to conditions between the stars. In psychology and medicine, a person's environment is the people, physical things and places that the person lives with. The environment affects the growth and development of the person. It affects the person's behavior, body, mind and heart. Discussions on nature versus nurture are sometimes framed as heredity vs. environment.</p>

                    The environment is an important issue even when society is faced with economic crises, wars, and unending social problems. It matters because Earth is the only home that humans have, and it provides air, food, and other needs.

                    <br>
                    Humanity's entire life support system depends on the well-being of all the species living on earth. This is commonly referred to as the biosphere, a term coined by Vladimir Vernadsky, a Russian scientist in the 1920s. Biosphere refers to one global ecological system in which all living things are interdependent. Within the overall biosphere or ecosystem, there are smaller ecosystems like the rainforests, oceans, the desert and the tundra.

                    <h2>Biodiversity</h2>
                    <p class="f1">
                            <strong>Biodiversity is the most complex and vital feature of our planet</strong>. It is essentially every living thing and ecosystem that makes up the environment. From the tallest giraffe to the smallest microorganism, everything plays an important role in the maintenance of our world.
                            But with the increase in global warming, pollution and deforestation, biodiversity is in danger. Billions of species are going or have gone extinct all over the world. Some scientists, in fact, are suggesting that we are in the beginning of a 6th mass extinction, posing issues for our planet and ourselves.Reducing our meat intake, particularly red meat, as well as making sustainable choices can help to keep our planet running smoothly.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Water</h2>
                    <p class="f1">
                        <strong>Water pollution is a huge concern for us and our environment</strong>. Not only is polluted water a huge financial strain but is also killing both humans and marine life. With oil spills, an abundance of plastic waste and toxic chemicals entering our waterways, we’re damaging the most valuable resource our planet has to offer.
                        By educating people on the causes and effects of water pollution, we can work together to undo the damage humans have caused. Laws also need to change to make pollution tougher, consistently across national borders.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Deforestation</h2>
                    <p class="f1">
                        We need plants and trees to survive. They provide oxygen, food, water and medicine for everyone, all over the globe. <strong>But if deforestation continues at the rate it’s occurring</strong>, we won’t have much of the valuable forestry left.
                        With natural wildfires, illegal logging and the mass amount of timber being harvested for commercial use, our forests are decreasing at an alarming rate. As well as reducing our supply of oxygen, the loss of forests is contributing around 15% of our greenhouse gas emissions.
                        To help, you can buy more recycled and organic products, limiting the amount of paper and cardboard you use.

                <li>
                    <h2>Pollution</h2>
                    <p class="f1">
                        <strong>Pollution is one of the primary causes of many of the other environmental concerns</strong>, including climate change and biodiversity. All 7 key types of pollution – air, water, soil, noise, radioactive, light and thermal – are affecting our environment.
                        All types of pollution, and environmental concerns, are interlinked and influence one another. So, to tackle one is to tackle them all. That’s why we need to work together, as a community, to reduce the impact that pollution is having on our environment.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                    <p class="f1">
                            As pointed out by a recent UN report, without <strong>‘unprecedented changes’</strong> in our actions and behaviour, our planet will suffer drastically from global warming in just 12 years. Greenhouses gases are the main cause of climate change, trapping in the sun’s heat and warming the surface of the earth.
                            An increased ocean temperature is affecting the sea life and ecosystems habituated there. The rise in global sea levels is shrinking our land, causing mass floods and freak weather incidents across the world. If we continue as we are, the world will suffer irreversibly.
                            Saying no to driving more will reduce your carbon footprint, as will switching off electrical items when they’re not in use. More importantly, we need to educate the world on the effects and severity of global warming, before it’s too late.

            <h1 class="title">Ways to Solve Environmental Problems</h1>
            <p class="f1">We are currently facing the most critical environmental issues in human history. Our climate, planet, lives, and future as a civilization are all at risk. While the magnitude of that thought can be extremely overwhelming, don’t allow yourself to feel helpless, not knowing where to begin. Making small steps and adjustments in your daily routine will give you a sense of success and a yearning to attempt more.
                Here are 5 simple ways you can help the environment and spark others to become more environmentally aware.</p>

            <h2>Replace disposable items with reusable</h2>
            <p>Anything you use and throw away can potentially spend <em>centuries</em> in a landfill. See below for simple adjustments you can make to decrease the amount of disposable items in your daily life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carry your own reusable cup or water bottle</li>
                <li>Use airtight, reusable food containers instead of sandwich bags and plastic wrap</li>
                <li>Pack a waste-free lunch: carry your utensils, cloth napkin, and containers in an reusable lunch bag</li>
                <li>Bring your own bags to the grocery store</li>
                <li>Consider buying bulk containers of your preferred beverages and refilling a reusable bottle, instead of buying individually-packaged drinks</li>
                <li>Use rechargeable batteries</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Pass on paper</h2>
    <p>We are living in the Digital Era, but think about all the paper products you use in your daily life. These actions still align with reusing and repurposing, though may take a little more time for transition.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Join a library instead of buying books or buy a Kindle</li>
        <li>Print as little as possible; and if you must, print on both sides</li>
        <li>Wrap gifts in fabric and tie with ribbon; both are reusable and prettier than paper and sticky-tape</li>
        <li>Stop using paper towels and incorporate washable cloths</li>
        <li>Look at labels to make sure you only use FSC-certified wood and paper products</li>
    <li>Cut out products made by palm oil companies that contribute to deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conserve water &amp; electricity</h2>
    <p>The tips you see below will seem like no-brainers; however, it may take to become more aware of your unconscious habits.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn the sink water off when brushing your teeth</li>
        <li>Water the lawn in the morning or evening; cooler air causes less evaporation</li>
        <li>Switch off anything that uses electricity when not in use (lights, televisions, computers, printers, etc.)</li>
        <li>Unplug devices when possible; even when an appliance is turned off, it may still use power</li>
        <li>Remove chemicals inside of the house; research companies that use plant-derived ingredients for their household cleaning products</li>
        <li>Remove chemicals outside of the house; use eco-friendly pesticides and herbicides that won’t contaminate groundwater</li>
    <li>Consider signing up for a renewable energy producer that uses 100% renewable energy to power homes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Support local &amp; environmentally friendly</h2>
    <p>Here are a few reasons to start buying local:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces plastic and paper waste</li>
        <li>Boosts cost efficiency</li>
        <li>Enables bulk purchasing</li>
        <li>Helps support your neighbors</li>
        <li>Retains farmland within the community</li>
        <li>Builds up the local economy</li>
    <li>Uses fewer chemicals for both for growing and transporting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Recycle (&amp; then recycle properly)</h2>
    <p>Implementing recycling habits into your daily life is one of the most effective ways to help lessen landfill waste, conserve natural resources, save habitats, reduce pollution, cut down on energy consumption, and slow down global warming.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Confirm you are using the proper separation containers for your household per the local recycling services</li>
        <li>Remember to make sure your trash bags are recycled or biodegradable, and always cut up the plastic rings from packs of beer or soda to prevent wildlife from getting caught</li>
        <li>Educate yourself about what can and cannot be recycled, as not all plastic and cardboard is acceptable (like pizza boxes for example, due to the grease) </li>
    <li>Learn how to identify and dispose of hazardous waste properly </li>
    </ul>
